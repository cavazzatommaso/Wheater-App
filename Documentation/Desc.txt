This is a WEB based (PHP, Javascript) app I put together from various tools & scripts found on the web to create my own Kitchen TV : News, Clock & Weather music player & web browser display.

If you want to set up the same thing: ======

1) Download my web files & upload to your own web space or host them locally.

2) EDIT the files to personalise it for your own needs:

* weather.js EDIT your city, country location.

* images/cface4.png EDIT the clock image if you want your own design. You will find the background colours for sunset, sunrise etc in the images folder too.

* index.php has a list of the YouTube LIVE channels, you can edit the list for your own channels
You just need the video ID, time in seconds you want it to display for (e.g.: 1200 seconds is 20 mins) & the Name to show in the Icon - A 2 letter code works best like SN for SkyNews ;-)

* The page layout is designed to fit my 720p TV. It will work on other screens but you would probably want to adjust the column widths etc slightly so it suits your screen. Look in the CSS files to adjust those parts. 

==============
+++ UPDATE ++++

If your BBC news feed isnt working you need to update the script to remove CDATA tags.

index.php, line 198
Update the clean function with str_replace to remove CDATA tags.

My download link above includes a fixed version & also without the music player - i found it to a little too resource hungry.

The resources I used to put this together:

- HTML5 analogue clock

- YouTube Javascript API

- Cincopa music player https://www.cincopa.com/
Still trying this out, you can remove it from index.php line 150 or sign up for your own account & replace it.
